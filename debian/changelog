sreview (0.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Uses a test video that is CC BY 3.0 instead of the one that was CC
      BY 2.0, which is not DFSG-free
    - Autodetects whether to use libfdk_aac based on whether ffmpeg
      supports it, rather than depending on the user to manually set it.
  * Add various fixes to the debian/ directory to make lintian slightly happier
